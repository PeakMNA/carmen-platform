# Subscription Controlling Platform - Text Results Display

## Subscription Model Structure

### Core Components
- **Business Units (BU)**: Individual operational entities
- **Clusters**: Groups of related Business Units
- **User Types**:
  - **Cluster Users**: Users with access to multiple BUs within a cluster
  - **BU Staff**: Users with access to a single Business Unit only
- **Module Activation**: Modules activated per Business Unit

### Subscription Formula
Subscription pricing and licensing is based on:
1. Number of Business Units
2. Number of Cluster Users
3. Number of BU Staff per Business Unit
4. Modules activated per Business Unit

## License Validation Logic

When a user attempts to access a module, the system validates:

```
IF (User is active)
  AND (User's assigned BU has not expired)
  AND (Module is activated for the BU)
  AND (User has permission for the module)
  AND (
       (User is BU Staff AND BU Staff license count not exceeded)
       OR 
       (User is Cluster User AND Cluster User license count not exceeded)
      )
THEN
  Grant Access
ELSE
  Deny Access with appropriate message
```
